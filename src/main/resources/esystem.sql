Well, not exactly.Fast food chains serve up a very different amount of salt in their foods depending on where they\'re operating. Researchers studied nutrition information from McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, Domino\'s, Pizza Hut and Subway in six different countries. They found that restaurants in the U.S. served saltier burgers, subs, pizza and chicken nuggets than those same outlets in the U.K. And the differences were more than a dash. A six-piece chicken nugget in Manchester, New Hampshire, contains 1.5 grams of salt, whereas in Manchester, England, it has just 0.6 grams―less than half. The findings are in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. The researchers also found that many of these meals contain more salt than doctors recommend getting in an entire day. Even salads were not entirely safe, with some containing seven grams of salt. So, if you can\'t travel to the U.K. for your drive-thru lunch, cut the salt by cutting your portions―or skipping the fast food altogether.', '科学美国人60秒:美国快餐含盐量更多', '无论你是在伦敦或卢博克市，一个巨无霸汉堡就是一个巨无霸汉堡，对吗？其实不然。快餐连锁店会根据店面位置调整所供应的食物中盐的含量。 研究人员研究了六个不同国家的麦当劳，汉堡王，肯德基，达美乐比萨，必胜客，赛百味提供的食物中的营养信息。 他们发现美国快餐店提供的汉堡、潜艇堡、披萨和鸡块比英国同类快餐店里的更咸。 差异很明显。在曼哈顿、新罕布什尔，一份6块的鸡块含有1.5克盐， 而在曼切斯特、英格兰，同样的套餐里只含有0.6克盐――少了一半之多。 这项发现刊登在《加拿大医学协会期刊》上。 研究人员还发现许多快餐中的盐含量超过了医生建议的每日盐摄入量的标准。 即使是沙拉也并不绝对安全，因为某些沙拉竟然含有7克盐。 所以，如果你不能去英国买清淡点的午餐外卖， 那么你只要减少食用的分量即可，或者你可以干脆不吃快餐。');

Sure, what is it about? My friend Tony has just finished his formality of entry into Singapore; he will be staying there for maybe a week or so to go on sightseeing there. Now he is worrying about his departure from there because he has no idea about the departure formalities. You know it very well professor, don\'t you? Well, I can tell you something about it, but I am afraid what I am going to say is just the general situation, since every country has its own way to deal with the problem. OK, I\'ve got it. Generally speaking, foreigners are allowed departure as long as the departure regulations and restrictions of the host country are satisfied. There is no reason for the host country to detain a foreigner. So tell your friend not to worry too much. It is easier to leave than to enter, what do you think? Yes, I guess so. But tell your friend to remember one point, that is almost all countries have such rules that foreigners can not leave the country until, they do not have unsettled judicial cases, debts, unpaid duties, besides they must go through departure formalities before they leave.', '外贸口语一点通第154期:出境入境之出境问询', ' ');

This number here represents your gross pay. Yes, that\'s easy enough to understand. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It\'s your federal income tax. And then there\'s Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. All right, I see.

It is clear to everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming, especially in the developing markets. If we are to succeed in this ultracompetitive field then we really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet their needs on all levels. As I hope I have illustrated, the x420 represents the kind of computer that can really satisfy those needs. I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new x420 range, and believe me, this is really just the beginning.

We will learn all about one of the oldest yet most delicious foods on this planet: cheese! Let\'s get started! Cheese is usually categorized into four types: soft, semi soft semi hard and hard. The designation refers to the amount of moisture in the cheese, which directly affects its texture. Making cheese is an ancient practice, dating back thousands of years, and the home cheese maker can usually find recipes for cheese that falls into any of the four categories. Soft cheese includes cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, brie, bleu, roquefort, mozzarella, meunster and similar cheeses.

To be honest, I \'m not that great at golf, but I have improved in the last few years. But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice. I \'ve lost my thread. What was I talking about again?

Then, they heard two different sentences played at the same time, but had to listen to and recall details from only one voice. Each voice drew a particular response from the auditory cortex. And even with an extra sentence playing simultaneously, researchers saw that the cortex responded specifically to the voice that the subject was focusing on.

Researchers outfitted rat cadavers with artificial beating hearts. They used dead rats to control for other signs of passing, like muscle spasms. Then they warmed up the rats, set the hearts pumping, and dangled them in front of hungry boas. The snakes attacked. And as long as that rat heart kept thumping, the boas kept tightening their coils and applying bursts of pressure, sometimes for more than 20 minutes. But as soon as scientists killed the heartbeat, the boas loosened up. Even captive born boas who \'d never hunted live prey paid attention to the pulse -- suggesting the behavior is innate.

Participants then completed a questionnaire designed to find out how hot or cold they felt.

Most people have two copies of a gene that enables them to detect a steroidal pheromone called androstenone -- which is found in male mammals, particularly porkers. But most pigs in developed countries have been chemically castrated. Which means much less androstenone in the meat. So, no strong smell. Now Europe is considering a ban on castration. Might pork from these intact males smell bad to people with the right genes? Researchers recruited 23 volunteers, who were screened for the ability to smell androstenone. Tests showed that those who were sensitive to the compound did indeed have two copies of the gene. And those who did not notice it or did not think it smelled bad mostly had one or no copies. The researchers then challenged the subjects with pork to which androstenone was added to match levels that would be found in meat from uncastrated males.

This behavior is called overindividuation and arises from the desire to be thoughtful and treat each gift-getter as unique.

For years he\'s calmly gathered stones and chunks of concrete, stacking them in piles, which he visits when some human particularly irks him. But lately Santino has gotten more cunning. For one, he\'s taken to concealing his arsenal beneath little heaps of hay that he carries out from his enclosure. And his attacks are also more stealthy.

Reaching the relevant populations often means traveling to areas， where electricity and refrigeration are spotty at best. Nearly half of the vaccine doses around the world are lost to the heat. Also, the cost of refrigeration contributes to about 80 percent of the cost of the vaccines. So silk experts at Tufts University have come up with a potential solution: encase the vaccines in silk protein. Silk proteins contain nanoscale pockets that can hold and protect biological compounds. Inside the silk protein wrap, the compounds stay biologically stable. In the lab, they were able to stabilize the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine for more than 6 months at a variety of tropical temperatures. The technology also worked with antibiotics. Stored at a month at temperatures reaching 140 degrees Fahrenheit, the antibiotics kept their potency. The research is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Researchers worked with a fungus called Stilbella aciculosa. As it makes spores, it also produces superoxide. That\'s a highly reactive kind of oxygen. When the released superoxide bumps into the mineral manganese in the environment, it makes that mineral much more reactive itself. The pepped-up manganese then grabs and holds a variety of toxic metals， and other substances that need to be cleaned up and gotten out of coal mine drainage water.

Off or on. But in quantum computers, that off/on logic becomes a little more flexible. Because the bits in quantum computing, called quantum bits or qubits, can actually be 0 AND 1 at the same time. Think of it like this: a coin flipping through the air can be considered to be both heads and tails before it lands. In that way, it\'s like a qubit. Until you measure it, the qubit is 0 and 1, just as until the coin lands, it\'s both heads and tails. But the quantum weirdness goes beyond simple qubits. Because physicists have also created pairs of photons, particles of light, called qudits, with a D, for multiple dimensions. And those dimensions are different colors of light. So instead of being just 0 and 1, like a regular quantum bit, these photon qudits are, for example, simultaneously pink and purple and red and orange.', '科学美国人60秒:多色光子的强大计算能力', ' ');

And he and his team have indeed designed a battery-free phone. It looks like a circuit board, with touch-responsive numeric buttons. And it runs on just a few microwatts of power, which it harvests from light, and from the radio signals emanating from a nearby wireless base station. The team achieved the battery-free, energy-efficient design by ditching two of power-hungry features of modern cell phones. One, the test unit skips digital to analog conversion. And two, it does not generate its own wireless signals to make calls. Instead, in receiving mode, it absorbs incoming radio waves from the base station, and converts them directly into vibrations of its speaker.', '科学美国人60秒:不需要电池的新型手机', ' ');

Researchers looked at soot and various greenhouse gases that don\'t last very long in the atmosphere, such as methane, ozone in the lower altitudes and the factory-made refrigerants known as HFCs. Previous studies have shown that cutting these types of air pollution could slow climate change, buying time to bring carbon dioxide emissions under control. The new research shows that such cuts would also significantly slow the rate of sea level rise― by more than 20 percent per year, which could keep the rise under a meter by the end of the century.

A decade ago, scientists found that Kenyan kids infected with plasmodium were more attractive to mosquitos than were kids who were parasite-free.

A clue to explaining this paradox came when researchers noticed that mice that were attacked by a cage mate wound up with an unusually large amount of sodium at the site of the bite.

On average, hangovers did postpone the next drink―but only by about 6 hours. The work is published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. In addition to discovering that hangovers fail to deter drinking, the study found that people with alcohol dependence or financial stress were more likely to develop hangovers.

The newfound system includes two black holes orbiting each other very closely, about 450 light-years apart, with a third black hole a bit farther out. The central pair zoom around each other at a fast clip, about 300 times the speed of sound on Earth. The hole trinity also represents the tightest trio of black holes known to date. It\'s described in the journal Nature. As these objects continue to orbit at the center of their galaxy, gravity will eventually pull them closer and closer together. Ultimately, they may even merge. Researchers hope this triple-black-hole system may be a good place to look for space-time ripples called gravitational waves. As their orbits shrink, the black holes should radiate away some of their orbital energy as the sought-after gravitational waves, predicted by Einstein a century ago.', '科学美国人60秒:太空新发现，\"黑洞三兄弟\"畅游银河系', '这里是科学美国人60秒，太空系列。我是克拉拉・莫斯科维兹。在大多数的银河系中都会隐藏着一个黑洞。 但是科学家竟然发现这个距离我们四百万光年的银河系的中央有多大三个黑洞。 这种拥有三个黑洞的银河系十分少见，目前只发现了四个。 这三个黑洞中，有两个相距450光年的黑洞绕着彼此做旋转运动，另外一个则离这两个距离较远。 中心的这一对黑洞运动速度非常快，相当于声音在地球上传播速度的300倍。 按照已知的所有相关数据，这三个黑洞是距离彼此最紧密的。 详情请见自然杂志。 随着这三个黑洞不停地在银河系中旋转，引力会最终把它们拉的越来越近。 最终，它们很可能会合并成一体。 研究人员希望在这个三个黑洞系统中，可以发现时光涟漪，专业上叫做重力波。 伴随着这三个黑洞的旋转轨道的范围缩小，它们会释放桑出一定量的轨道能量，也就是人们向往看到的重力波，关于这一点，爱因斯坦早在一个世纪以前就提出过猜想。');

But NASA’s GRACE satellites, for Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, can pick up changes in the gravity field in a given river basin. The more water in the basin, the higher the gravity signal.

Researchers used small digital recorders hidden in the vests of 11-and 14-month old babies to record the infants\' auditory environment. Thirty-second snippets were then analyzed to identify whether the parents used baby talk or regular speech, and whether speech occurred in one-on-one or group settings. The more parents engaged in one-on-one baby talk, the more the baby babbled―which is a precursor to word production―and the more words they produced at age two. The study will appear in the journal Developmental Science.

They saw that older, wizened females were the individuals most likely to lead younger whales to salmon feeding grounds, especially during lean times. The study is in the journalCurrent Biology.

But macaws are a tropical bird, whose range never extended north of today\'s U.S.-Mexico border. So how did the pueblo people obtain the birds? To examine the birds\' origin, scientists sequenced mitochondrial DNA found within macaw bones from two sites in New Mexico: Chaco Canyon and the Mimbres region. meaning the ancient birds came from the same maternal line.
